          <p>1). Your software development team has developed a really nice prototype
            of a system for monitoring textile waste containers and alerting when
            they are getting full. However, requirements and further roadmap for
            the system are not very clear. Your customer finds the prototype impressive
            and wants to extend it to be the actual system. Study the prototyping
            method by using the lecture material (Lecture 2) and online sources.</p>

                  <pre>Prototypes arent tested for all use cases, they can contain errors and other issues (scalability, unpredictability, optimization, security).
Because prototypes are often developen on a short period, the developers might have had to cut some corners.
Using prototypes as they are will likely result in technical debt.
So redoing the initial steps and taking time to design will save money and make maintenance of the product easier later on.</pre>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Compared to traditional, hierarchical pland-based project managment,
                Scrum teams are more flexible, team members may have multiple roles
                and switch tasks. Scrum teams are more self-organized and members
                may share tasks among team members.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Unlike in traditional plan-based teams, Scrum approach allows for active
                customer involment. Scrum approach encourages keeping connection
                with customers. In Scrum Product Owner has special position in different
                Scrum meetings. Traditionally customer involment is usually limited
                to preplanned project milestones and detailed documentation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Backlogs add transparency in Scrum projects. Scrum projects also revisit
                these blacklogs quite often. Sprint reviews and daily scrum meetings
                ensure transparency between different roles and teams. Traditonal
                plan-based project managments mostly relies on documentation, which
                creates transparency in theory. Documentation isn&#8217;t very flexible
                and it propably wont cover changes in the project. Plan-based project
                managment doesen&#8217;t include consistant inspection of progress
                between different teams.</p>
